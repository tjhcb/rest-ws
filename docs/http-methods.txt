HTTP Methods
1. GET - safe method as it does not change state of the resource. 
	Idempotent as multiple identical requests must produce the same result every time
	until another API (POST or PUT) has changed the state of the resource on the server.
2. POST - used to create a new/subordinate resource into the collection of resources.
	Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields.
	Neither safe nor idempotent
3. PUT - primarily to update existing resource (if the resource does not exist then API may decide to create a new resource or not).
	Responses to this method are not cacheable.
	POST requests are made on resource collections whereas PUT requests are made on an individual resource.
4. DELETE - used to delete resources (identified by the Request-URI)
	DELETE operations are idempotent.
	Responses to this method are not cacheable.
5. PATCH - to make partial update on a resource
6. HEAD - Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only
7. CONNECT - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI
8. TRACE - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
